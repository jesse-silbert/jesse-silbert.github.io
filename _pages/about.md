Hi! I am a PhD student at the Princeton University Department of Economics interested in labor markets, industrial organization, market design, higher education, and information economics.

In addition to economics, I am passionate about weird music and good food.

[Market Design for a Monopsonistic Labor Market](https://jesse-silbert.github.io/files/market_design_monopsony.pdf) (with [Wilbur Townsend](https://wilburtownsend.github.io))

Abstract:

*When firms have monopsony power, labor markets can be inefficient. This paper asks whether centralized matching can make monopsonistic labor markets more efficient. We construct a job-matching model with fungible workers in which each firm must pay all its workers the same salary. This restriction generates monopsonistic inefficiencies: while the core contains efficient allocations, it can contain inefficient alloca- tions as well. Workers prefer an efficient core allocation over any other core allocation. Firms prefer inef- ficient core allocations in which they pay lower salaries and thus extract greater profits. When production technologies are public information, a strategyproof mechanism can elicit how workers value employment, and thus implement an efficient core allocation. However, no strategyproof mechanism can elicit firmsâ€™ production technologies. Thus centralized matching can improve monopsonistic labor markets when the market designer observes production.*
