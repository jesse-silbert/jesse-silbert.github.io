Hi! I am a Ph.D. student at the Princeton University Department of Economics interested in labor markets, industrial organization, matching markets, market design, and online platform markets.

In addition to economics, I am passionate about weird music and good food.

**Research:**

[Stable Matching in Monopsonistic Labor Markets](https://wilburtownsend.github.io/papers/market%20design%20monopsony.pdf) (with [Wilbur Townsend](https://wilburtownsend.github.io)), 2022.

Abstract:


This paper asks whether centralized matching can make monopsonistic labor markets more efficient. We construct a job matching model in which each firm views workers as interchangeable and must pay all its workers the same salary. This requirement generates monopsonistic distortions: While an efficient stable outcome will always exist, inefficient outcomes can be stable as well. There exists an efficient stable outcome that workers prefer over any other stable outcome. Firms prefer inefficient stable outcomes in which they pay lower salaries and thus extract greater profits. When production technologies are public information, a strategyproof mechanism can elicit how workers value employment, and thus implement an efficient stable outcome. However, no strategyproof mechanism can elicit firmsâ€™ production technologies. Thus, centralized matching can improve monopsonistic labor markets when the market designer observes production.
