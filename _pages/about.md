Hi! I am a PhD student at the Princeton University Department of Economics interested in labor markets, higher education, industrial organization, market design, and microeconomic theory.

In addition to economics, I am passionate about weird music and good food.

title: "[Market Design for a Monopsonistic Labor Market](http://jesse-silbert.github.io/files/job_matching_without_wage_discrimination.pdf) (with [Wilbur Townsend](https://wilburtownsend.github.io))"
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'When firms have monopsony power, labor markets can be inefficient. This paper asks whether centralized matching can make monopsonistic labor markets more efficient. We construct a job-matching model with fungible workers in which each firm must pay all its workers the same salary. This restriction generates monopsonistic inefficiencies: while the core contains efficient allocations, it can contain inefficient alloca- tions as well. Workers prefer an efficient core allocation over any other core allocation. Firms prefer inef- ficient core allocations in which they pay lower salaries and thus extract greater profits. When production technologies are public information, a strategyproof mechanism can elicit how workers value employment, and thus implement an efficient core allocation. However, no strategyproof mechanism can elicit firmsâ€™ production technologies. Thus centralized matching can improve monopsonistic labor markets when the market designer observes production.'
