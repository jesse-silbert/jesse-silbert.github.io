I am a Ph.D. student at the Princeton University Department of Economics. I am on the 2025-2026 academic job market.

I study empirical industrial organization, labor markets, the economics of AI, two-sided platforms, and matching theory.

**Job Market Paper:**

Making Talk Cheap: Generative AI and Labor Market Signaling (with [Anaïs Galdin](https://www.anaisgaldin.com/home)).

[Draft coming soon!]

Abstract:

This paper studies how large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT lower the cost of producing written communication and disrupt markets that have traditionally relied on writing as a costly signal of quality (e.g., job applications, college essays). Using data from Freelancer.com, a major digital labor platform, we explore the effects of LLMs' disruption of labor market signaling on equilibrium market outcomes. We develop a novel LLM-based measure to quantify how tailored an application is to a given job posting. Taken to the data, the measure significantly predicts labor demand in the period before LLMs are introduced, but not after. Motivated by this finding, we develop a structural model of labor market signaling, in which workers invest costly effort to produce noisy signals that predict their ability in equilibrium. We estimate the model on pre-LLM data using a novel simulation-based estimator, and then simulate a counterfactual equilibrium in which LLMs reduce writing costs to zero, dismantling workers' capacity to signal their ability. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that LLMs cause employers to divert hiring away from higher ability workers towards lower ability workers, thereby lowering wages and leading to a reduction in worker surplus and virtually no effect on employer surplus.

**Revise and Resubmit, Games and Economic Behavior**

Abstract:


In many labor markets, firms do not price discriminate among their workers. In this paper, we study how a labor market with uniform salaries matches workers to jobs. To do so, we construct a job matching model in which each firm views workers as interchangeable and must pay all its workers the same salary. While an efficient stable outcome  always exists, inefficient outcomes can be stable as well. Workers' preferred stable outcome is efficient. In contrast, firms prefer inefficient stable outcomes in which they pay lower salaries. Though a strategyproof mechanism that implements an efficient stable outcome can elicit how workers value employment, it cannot elicit firms' production technologies.
