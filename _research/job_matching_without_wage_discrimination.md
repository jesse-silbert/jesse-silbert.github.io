excerpt: 'When firms have monopsony power, labor markets can be inefficient. This paper asks whether centralized matching can make monopsonistic labor markets more efficient. We construct a job-matching model with fungible workers in which each firm must pay all its workers the same salary. This restriction generates monopsonistic inefficiencies: while the core contains efficient allocations, it can contain inefficient alloca- tions as well. Workers prefer an efficient core allocation over any other core allocation. Firms prefer inef- ficient core allocations in which they pay lower salaries and thus extract greater profits. When production technologies are public information, a strategyproof mechanism can elicit how workers value employment, and thus implement an efficient core allocation. However, no strategyproof mechanism can elicit firms’ production technologies. Thus centralized matching can improve monopsonistic labor markets when the market designer observes production.'

Abstract:
When firms have monopsony power, labor markets can be inefficient. This paper asks whether centralized matching can make monopsonistic labor markets more efficient. We construct a job-matching model with fungible workers in which each firm must pay all its workers the same salary. This restriction generates monopsonistic inefficiencies: while the core contains efficient allocations, it can contain inefficient alloca- tions as well. Workers prefer an efficient core allocation over any other core allocation. Firms prefer inef- ficient core allocations in which they pay lower salaries and thus extract greater profits. When production technologies are public information, a strategyproof mechanism can elicit how workers value employment, and thus implement an efficient core allocation. However, no strategyproof mechanism can elicit firms’ production technologies. Thus centralized matching can improve monopsonistic labor markets when the market designer observes production.
